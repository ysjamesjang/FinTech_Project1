Begin with speaking on how my first step was to research using the Zillow API
	
	- The Zillow API was found to only be for commercial use
	- Zillow provided me with a link that provided me with many datasets, I chose to use the ones on Median Home Prices

	- Data Set Up / Cleaning steps


	1. Data was organized by Metro Area / Monthly from APR-1996 through APR 2021
	
		* First: Define 4 Regions Northeast / Midwest / South / West
		* Second: Group by the 4 Regions
		* Third: Transpose the Data to show Regions in the Columns and the Dates in the Rows
		* Fourth: Slice my dataset by dates:
			1. 2015-FEB 2020; Prediction Dataset
			2. FEB 2020 - APR -2021: Actuals Dataset

	2. My Model was based on a MCSim following a Normal Distribution

		* Running 100 Simulations for 14 Instances (Equaling number of months in Actuals Dataset)
		* Used scypy.stats / norm to normalize my data for the prediction as well as providing 95% CI's 
		* Two Functions were created and ran: 
			1. To run simulation on Prediction Data Set and Plot Simulations
			2. To Plot Actuals Data and define difference between Simulation and Actuals
	3. Results: 

		* Hypothesis was that the Midwest showed the higher growth / difference in predicted
		* Order:
			1. Midwest 2. South 3. West 4. Northwest

		* Based on this Model - which was based on only one variable (Median Housing Market) we see that Northeast Housing Prices 
		  were shown to be 3 times higher against the projected price than the Midwest
.

	4. Conclusion: 
	
		* For future analysis: Since I only used the one variable in my predictive analysis, I would like to include the variables that were discussed earlier
				       since they are definitely real-world applicable - and test and train my model on that, so that we could have a more robust and
				       conclusive prediction

# FinTech_Project1

### Project Scope
- To calculate housing price MoM growth rates before and after pandemic with Quandl’s state dataset broken into four regions. 
- IF TIME ALLOWS OR DATASET IS AVAILABLE, investigate the real estate market between city vs suburb, mortgage rate trends, foreclosure rate trends, and income/savings rate trends. Draw parallels to different points in history where we had similar rates for factors above. Create a best fit equation where we use the factors above as inputs and get house price as output.  

### Hypothesis
- Region: The Midwest region has seen the highest increase in America over any other region. 
- Mortgage rate: Investigate the supply and demand of real estate by focusing on mortgage rates. If the mortgage rate is low, then housing prices will increase because of increased demand. 
- Foreclosure rate: There is a low supply of houses in America that is driving up real estate prices due to pandemic-specific regulations meant to protect people losing jobs (ie. hold on foreclosures). 
- Income: The pandemic has caused increased disposable income and savings rate in America. Potential home-buyers, having more money, has driven up prices for the real estate market. 
- City vs suburb: City real estate prices have dropped and suburb real estate prices have increased.

### Action Items
- Clean housing price time series dataset. Add columns later
- Mark a specific cutoff time for pandemic (Nov ’19; Jan ’20; March ’20)
- Ensure that datetime column is standardized
- Create geographic plot of regions based on real estate price rate before and after pandemic
- Create correlation table of mortgage rate, foreclosure rate and income rate on house prices
- Monte Carlo simulations of real estate market, homebuilder companies, lumber selling companies

### Appendix

- Area of Focus: Real Estate 

- Datasets: Kaggle; Zillow; Quandl; Alex’s dataset

Instructor Guidance:
- Order business questions in descending priority
- Identify the data components required to answer the business questions 
- Set a time limit to tackle one business question and its data components. Rinse and repeat down the list. 
- National Association of Realtors
- Proxy in parts of US to investigate buying pressure and trends. There are trenches that are affected more than others due to a function of purchasing power. Identify the rate of change in housing starts of high-power regions over low-power regions; cost of living (demand is concentrated on properties of high middle class or above).
- Atlanta + Orlando: Southern region 
- Take average of 20 cities and compare to regionalized data

Tools
- Trend linked to costs? Lumber other input? 
- Use zillow estimates datasets
- Growth rate? 
- Investment opportunity? 
- We have city data.
- Do we have suburban data? Or smaller metro area?  

Queries:
- Home Prices per region and YoY growth
- Rent Prices per region and YoY increase
- Gather data from 2014-2019 (if possible?) create MC sim
- Plot actual 2020 prices
- Compare sim to actual data
- Predicting 2020 top buying / renting destinations
- Plotting actual top destinations
- Interest Rate correlation?
- Loan amount correlation to sales
- Google search correlation on increase in home sales per region?
- Price of commodities related to home prices
- Who had the outsized demand? 
- Who profited the most from the increased demand? 
- New housing start permits
- Available in a per-city basis
- National Homebuilding 
- Analyze major markets of real estate companies (ie. Lennar Homes, Pulte Homes, DR Horton, Realtor Association, KB Home (entry-homebuilder), Zillow) to find dynamic of big markets’ influence on lumber through higher purchasing power over smaller regional builders.
